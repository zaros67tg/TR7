# TR7
TR7 is an experimental logic translator that simulates how machines could theoretically represent human language using structured, symbolic positional encoding. Unlike standard encryption, TR7 converts text into a deterministic, mathematical format based on Block and Position coordinates.This tool serves as an educational sandbox to explore:Human-to-Machine abstraction: Converting familiar alphabets into abstract dot-notation.Positional logic: Understanding data through coordinate systems rather than direct mapping.Data integrity: Visualizing how strict validation rules apply to symbolic data.⚡ Key Features (Protocol v1.1)Bidirectional Translation: Instantly encode text to symbols and decode symbols back to text.Dynamic Logic Engine:Configurable Block Sizes: Change the mathematical base (e.g., Block size 6 vs. 10) to see how the encoding shifts.Custom Separators: Switch between spaces, slashes (/), or dots (·) for token boundaries.Robust Validation: The decoder includes strict syntax checking, identifying malformed tokens or mathematical impossibilities with visual error flags (?).Dark/Light Mode: A fully persistent theme system that respects user preference.System Diagnostics: Built-in cryptographic self-test to verify logic integrity in real-time.Offline Capable: Available as a standalone Windows Application (.exe).🧠 How It WorksTR7 uses a Positional Coordinate System rather than a simple substitution cipher.The Alphabet is divided into Blocks of a specific size (default: 6).Each letter is defined by: (Block Number) | (Position in Block)Example (Block Size 6):A is the 1st letter of Block 1 $\rightarrow$ .|.G is the 1st letter of Block 2 $\rightarrow$ ..|.🛠️ Technical StackCore Logic: Vanilla JavaScript (No external logic libraries).Interface: HTML5 & CSS3 (Responsive Grid Layout).Desktop Wrapper: Electron (Chromium-based runtime).Performance: Lightweight, client-side execution with zero latency.
